Crime Rate Prediction and Analysis 🚔📊

A data-driven machine learning project that analyzes historical crime data to identify patterns and predict crime rates for better decision-making and public safety planning.

This project focuses on practical ML workflows: data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization — not just theory.

🔍 Problem Statement

Crime is influenced by multiple socio-economic and temporal factors. Raw crime data alone is useless unless it is analyzed, visualized, and modeled properly.

The goal of this project is to:

Analyze crime trends from historical datasets

Identify key factors affecting crime rates

Predict future crime occurrences using machine learning models

Present insights through clear visualizations

🎯 Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations

Clean and preprocess real-world crime data

Train machine learning models to predict crime rates

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Visualize crime trends and predictions in an understandable format
